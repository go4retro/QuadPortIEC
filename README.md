# QuadPortIEC
Extremely simple 4 port IEC "extension" port.

This hardly qualifies as a design.  In 2010, Sean Kenny asked if I could design a simple board that allowed him to "disable" some of the drives on the IEC drive bus so he could have multiple devices with the same device number.  The design relies on the fact that an IEC device can be effectively "hidden" by interrupting the ATN line to that device.  

Feel free to use as desired.  Files are in EAGLE CAD format.
